# shchi da kasha

Cabbage soup and buckwheat porridge, that's what we eat -- or in Russian, ["schchi da kasha, pisha nasha"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shchi).

This is an API for working with daily personal metrics like weights, habits, and practices.

## Currently
Right now this project is under construction and I'm working on infrastructure tasks like setting up testing and hosting.

## Coming up
I'll add handling for more metrics I'd like to track and start building a front end.

## Run it:
> docker-compose build && docker-compose up
