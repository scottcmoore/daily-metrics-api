# daily-metrics-api

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/scottcmoore/daily-metrics-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/scottcmoore/daily-metrics-api)

## Currently
Right now this project is under construction and I'm working on infrastructure tasks like setting up testing and hosting.

## Coming up
I'll add handling for more metrics I'd like to track and start building a front end. Also there are things like DB credentials in this repo, so before running this anywhere but locally, those need to be handled differently.

## Run it:
> docker-compose build && docker-compose up
