# schchi da kasha

Cabbage soup and buckwheat porridge, that's our daily fare -- or in Russian, ["schchi da kasha, pisha nasha"](https://comradekitchen.wordpress.com/2015/09/14/shchi-da-kasha-pisha-nasha-shchi-and-kasha-thats-our-fare/).

This is an API for storing daily personal metrics like weights, habits, and practices.

## Currently
Right now this project is under construction and I'm working on infrastructure tasks like setting up testing and hosting.

## Coming up
I'll add handling for more metrics I'd like to track and start building a front end.

## Run it:
> docker-compose build && docker-compose up
